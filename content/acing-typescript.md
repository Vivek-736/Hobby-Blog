# Introduction

TypeScript is a powerful, statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers excellent tooling and developer experience, making it a popular choice for large-scale applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with TypeScript, you need to install it via npm:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

You can then create a TypeScript file with the `.ts` extension and compile it using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`):

```bash
tsc example.ts
```

## Basic Types

TypeScript provides several basic types that you can use to annotate your variables and function return types:

```typescript
let isDone: boolean = false;
let age: number = 30;
let name: string = "John Doe";
let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
```

## Interfaces

Interfaces in TypeScript allow you to define the shape of an object. They are useful for type-checking and ensuring that objects conform to a specific structure:

```typescript
interface Person {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;
}

function greet(person: Person) {
    return `Hello, ${person.firstName} ${person.lastName}`;
}

let user = { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe", age: 25 };
console.log(greet(user));
```

## Classes

TypeScript supports object-oriented programming with classes. You can define classes with properties and methods, and create instances of those classes:

```typescript
class Animal {
    name: string;

    constructor(name: string) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    move(distance: number = 0) {
        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distance} meters.`);
    }
}

let dog = new Animal("Dog");
dog.move(10);
```

## Generics

Generics allow you to create reusable components that work with a variety of types. They provide a way to create flexible and type-safe functions and classes:

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}

let output1 = identity<string>("Hello");
let output2 = identity<number>(42);
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static types, interfaces, classes, and generics, among other features. It helps catch errors early and improves code maintainability. By learning TypeScript, you can write more robust and scalable applications.

Happy coding!
