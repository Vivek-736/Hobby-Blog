# Introduction
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without writing CSS. It is highly customizable and allows developers to create responsive and modern web interfaces quickly.

## What is Tailwind CSS?
Tailwind CSS is different from traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation. Instead of providing pre-designed components, it offers utility classes that can be combined to create any design. This approach gives developers more control over the appearance of their applications.
