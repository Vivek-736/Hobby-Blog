# Introduction

Next.js is a powerful framework for building server-side rendered React applications. It provides a number of features that make it easy to build high-performance, SEO-friendly web applications.

## What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

Server-side rendering is the process of rendering web pages on the server instead of in the browser. This means that the HTML for a page is generated on the server and sent to the client, where it can be displayed immediately. This can improve performance and SEO, as search engines can index the content more easily.

## Benefits of Using Next.js

1. **Improved Performance**: By rendering pages on the server, Next.js can deliver content faster, especially for users with slower internet connections.
2. **SEO Optimization**: Server-side rendering makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index your content, improving your site's SEO.
3. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller bundles, which can be loaded on demand, reducing the initial load time.
4. **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to create API endpoints within your application, making it easy to handle server-side logic and data fetching.
5. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Next.js supports static site generation, allowing you to pre-render pages at build time for even better performance.

## Getting Started with Next.js

To get started with Next.js, you can create a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-nextjs-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

## File-Based Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system, which means that the structure of your files in the `app` directory determines the routes of your application. For example, if you create a file called `about/page.jsx` in the `app` directory, it will be accessible at `/about`.

### Example

Create a new file `app/about/page.jsx`:

```jsx
// app/about/page.jsx
import React from 'react';

const About = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>This is the about page.</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default About;
```

Now, navigating to `/about` in your browser will display the content of the `About` component.

## Dynamic Routing

Next.js also supports dynamic routing, which allows you to create routes with dynamic parameters. This is useful for pages that display content based on a specific identifier, such as a blog post or user profile.

### Example

Create a new file `[id]/page.jsx` in the `app` directory:

```jsx
// app/[id]/page.jsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const Post = () => {
    const router = useRouter();
    const { id } = router.query;

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Post {id}</h1>
            <p>This is the content of post {id}.</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Post;
```

Now, navigating to `/1`, `/2`, etc., will display the content of the `Post` component with the corresponding `id`.

## API Routes

Next.js allows you to create API routes to handle server-side logic and data fetching. These routes are created in the `app/api` directory.

### Example

Create a new file `hello/route.ts` in the `app/api` directory:

```javascript
// app/api/hello/route.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello, world!' });
}
```

Now, navigating to `/api/hello` in your browser will return a JSON response with the message "Hello, world!".

## App Router

Next.js provides an `App` component that allows you to customize the default behavior of your application. This component can be used to add global styles, layout components, and more.

### Example

In Pages router, we follow the below process
Create a new file `_app.js` in the `pages` directory:

```jsx
// pages/_app.js
import '../styles/globals.css';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
    return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

In this example, the `MyApp` component wraps all the pages in your application, allowing you to add global styles and other customizations.

## Conclusion

Next.js offers a powerful and flexible framework for building server-side rendered React applications. With features like file-based routing, dynamic routing, API routes, and the App component, you can easily create high-performance, SEO-friendly web applications.

Happy coding!
